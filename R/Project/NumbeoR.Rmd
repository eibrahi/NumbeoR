# Setup of the PostgreSQL database

---

## Establishing connection to PostgreSQL




```{r echo=TRUE}
pw = configFile[2]

# loads the PostgreSQL driver
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL") 

# creates a connection to the postgres database; "con" is used to connect to the database
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "NumbeoR",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = "postgres", password = pw)

# removes the password
rm(pw)

```


---

## Creation of database
A database with the name "NumbeoR" in PostgreSQL has to be created manually. 

---

## Creation of tables

```{sql connection=con}
DROP Table cost_of_living, crime, health_care, pollution, property_investment, traffic
```


Six different tables need to be created:

```{sql echo=TRUE, connection=con}
CREATE TABLE cost_of_living (
    "Year" integer,                                   -- Year
    "Country" text,                                   -- Country
    "Cost of Living Index" numeric,                   -- Cost of Living Index

    "Price To Income Ratio" numeric,              
    "Gross Rental Yield City Centre" numeric,                        
    "Gross Rental Yield Outside of Centre" numeric,

# Data import

---
The basic activity in the beginning of the project is to read in the JSON files containing scraped data from NumbeoR, to create dataframe and finally memorizing the data into PostgreSQL.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# generate full path to the dataImport.json
pathToDataJson <- paste0(path, "daten/dataImport.json")
pathToTableJson <- paste0(path, "daten/tableNamesImport.json")

# reeding the dataImport and tableNames json
my_files <- fromJSON(file = pathToDataJson)
my_tables <- fromJSON(file= pathToTableJson)

# creating lists
my_data <- list()
df_temp_my_data <- list()
df_my_data <- list()

for (i in 1 : length(my_files)) {
    # creating a list of JSON datafiles importing from Github
    my_data[[i]] <- fromJSON(file = my_files[i])
   
     # transform JSON files to dataframes, for each JSON file one dataframe
    df_temp_my_data[[i]] <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, my_data[[i]])
    
    # transpose dataframes to get the required structure
    df_my_data[[i]] <- as.data.frame(t(df_temp_my_data[[i]]))  
    
    # Writing data into PostgreSQL
    dbWriteTable(con, my_tables[i], value = df_my_data[[i]], append = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)
}
```

# Export Data From PostgreSQL

---

There are different ways for exporting and further preparing data from PostgreSQL.  
One could export with sQL codes.  
We use R codes instead.

---
class: center, middle

## R code

---

Export of the different tables with the help of dbGetQuery function

```{r}
df_cost_of_living_postgres <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * from cost_of_living")
df_crime_postgres <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * from crime")
df_health_care_postgres <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * from health_care")
df_pollution_postgres <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * from pollution")
df_property_investment_postgres <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * from property_investment")
df_traffic_postgres <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * from traffic")
```

---
Joining the data to one master dataframe

```{r}
df_master <- full_join(full_join(full_join(full_join(full_join(df_cost_of_living_postgres, df_crime_postgres, by = c("Country", "Year")),df_health_care_postgres, by = c("Country", "Year")), df_pollution_postgres, by = c("Country", "Year")), df_property_investment_postgres, by = c("Country", "Year")), df_traffic_postgres, by = c("Country", "Year"))


df_master
```

```{r}
df_master <- distinct(df_master)

```

```{r}
df_master
```

---

Filtering the master dataframe for country 'Germany'

```{r}
filter(df_master, Country=="Germany")
```

# Data Understanding and Preparation

---
## Approach:

* Detailed inspection of data and data structure
* Selection of content to be used afterwards
* Outlier detection with the help of descriptive statistics
* Data cleansing (e.g. outlier, NaNs)
* Final validation and verification of data set

---
class: center, middle

## Data inspection

---

A summary of dataframe structure and data types can be illustrated with the glimpse function:
```{r}
glimpse(df_master)
```

---

Furthermore we would like to add the information in which continent the country is.

Therefore we import a table which includes a country continent mapping

```{r}
countryContinent <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eibrahi/NumbeoR/master/daten/CountryContinent.csv",header=TRUE, sep=";")
colnames(countryContinent) <- c("Country", "Continent")
```

---

Checking the data types we see that the data was defined as factors

```{r}
glimpse(countryContinent)
```

Therefore we change the data types to characters 
```{r}
countryContinent[] <- lapply(countryContinent, as.character)
```

```{r}
glimpse(countryContinent)
```

---

Now we can join the continents to the master dataframe with the help of a left_join function:

```{r}
df_master_continent <- left_join(df_master,countryContinent, by="Country")
```

Checking the number of NA values within the column 'Continent' shows that there are no ones
```{r}
sum(is.na(df_master_continent["Continent"]))

```

```{r}
df_master_continent[rowSums(is.na(df_master_continent["Continent"])) > 0,]
```

For every country one contintent could be assigened.

```{r}
glimpse(df_master_continent)
```

---
class: center, middle

## Data selection

---

Selection of variables which are to be used in later analyses

```{r}
df_analysis <- select(df_master_continent, Year, Country, 'Cost of Living Index', 'Rent Index',
    'Local Purchasing Power Index', 'Gross Rental Yield City Centre',
    'Gross Rental Yield Outside of Centre',
    'Mortgage As A Percentage Of Income', 'Crime Index', 'Health Care Index',
    'Pollution Index', 'Traffic Index', 'Time Index(in minutes)',
    'CO2 Emission Index', Continent)


```



```{r}
df_analysis

```

```{r}
glimpse(df_analysis)
```

---
class: center, middle

## Data Cleansing

---
### Deletion of NA values

Sum of NA values can be ascertained as following:
```{r}
sum(is.na(df_analysis))
```

The observations which contain at least one NA values can be identified with the following command:

```{r}
df_analysis[rowSums(is.na(df_analysis)) > 0,]
```

---

All rows containing NA values can be deleted with the na.omit function:

```{r}
df_analysis_clean <- na.omit(df_analysis)

```

Checking on how many NA values are in the new clean dataframe shows that there are none

```{r}
sum(is.na(df_analysis_clean))
```

The new structure of the dataframe is
```{r}
glimpse(df_analysis_clean)
```


---

```{r}
df_analysis_clean_2019 <- filter(df_analysis_clean, Year == 2019)
```

---

```{r}
drops <- c("Year","Country", "Continent")
df_master_numeric <- df_master_continent[ , !(names(df_master_continent) %in% drops)]
df_master_numeric <- na.omit(df_master_numeric)
```


```{r}
df_analysis_numeric <- select(df_master_numeric, 'Cost of Living Index', 'Rent Index',
    'Local Purchasing Power Index', 'Gross Rental Yield City Centre',
    'Gross Rental Yield Outside of Centre',
    'Mortgage As A Percentage Of Income', 'Crime Index', 'Health Care Index',
    'Pollution Index', 'Traffic Index', 'Time Index(in minutes)',
    'CO2 Emission Index')

```

```{r}
sum(is.na(df_analysis_numeric))
```

## Correlations

---
### Correlation matrix

First, a correlation matix will be generated with the help of the corrplot package

```{r echo=FALSE}

corrplot(cor(df_analysis_numeric), method = "circle")
```




The Cost of Living Index is a dependent variable of the Rent Index and the Local Purchasing Power Index. So further correlation analyses are not reasonable. 

But we see that the Pollution Index could be negatively correlated with the Local Purchasing Power Index and with the Cost of Living Index. 

The CO2 Emission Index could be positively correlated with Gross Rerntal Yields and Crime Index.  

Furthermore, the Health Care Index seems to be positively correlated with the Local Purchasing Power Index. 
This will be examined in the following

--- 

### Pollution vs. Local Purchasing Power

The function rcorr() [in Hmisc package] can be used to compute the significance levels (p-value) for pearson or spearman correlations. It returns both the correlation coefficients and the p-value of the correlation for all possible pairs of columns in the data table.

Here, we show the (negative) correlation of two variables Polltion Index and Local Purchasing Power Index:
```{r}
corN <- rcorr(as.matrix(select(df_analysis_numeric,`Pollution Index`,`Local Purchasing Power Index`)))
corN
```


see http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/correlation-matrix-a-quick-start-guide-to-analyze-format-and-visualize-a-correlation-matrix-using-r-software

---

### Pollution vs. Cost of Living

Here, we show the (negative) correlation of two variables Polltion Index and Cost of Living Index:
```{r}
corN <- rcorr(as.matrix(select(df_analysis_numeric,`Pollution Index`,`Cost of Living Index`)))
corN
```

---

### CO2 Emission  vs. Gross Rental Yield

Here, we show the (positive) correlation of variable CO2 Emission Index and the two indexes for Gross Rental Yields:
```{r}
corN <- rcorr(as.matrix(select(df_analysis_numeric,`CO2 Emission Index`,`Gross Rental Yield City Centre`)))
corN
```

```{r}
corN <- rcorr(as.matrix(select(df_analysis_numeric,`CO2 Emission Index`,`Gross Rental Yield Outside of Centre`)))
corN
```


---

### Health Care  vs. Local Purchasing Power

The correlation of the two variables Health Care Index and the Local Purchasing Power:
```{r}
corN <- rcorr(as.matrix(select(df_analysis_numeric,`Health Care Index`,`Local Purchasing Power Index`)))
corN
```

---

### Visualization

---

#### Boxplots for Crime Index

```{r echo=FALSE}
crime_plot_2019 <- ggplot(data=df_analysis_clean_2019, mapping=aes(x=Continent, y=`Crime Index`)) +
                         geom_boxplot()
                     
ggplotly(crime_plot_2019)
```



---
#### Scatter Plot

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crime_health_plot_2019 <- ggplot(df_analysis_clean_2019) +
    geom_point(
        mapping = aes(x = `Pollution Index`, y = `Cost of Living Index`,color= Continent, points=Country)
        )

ggplotly(crime_health_plot_2019)
```

# Forecasting


---

## General 

What? 
We are going to analyse the **crime rate**.

What for?
We are analyizing the crime rate for **Germany**?

For which time horizon?
We are analyizing the crime rate for Germany for the years **2012 until 2019**?


Note:
This chapter is in general according to [Forecasting: Principles and Practice - February 2019](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) and [Forecasting: Principles and Practice - April 2018](https://otexts.com/fpp2/) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos 

---
class: center, middle

## Data Preparation

---
### Preparation Dataframe

Filter dataframe only for Germany

```{r}
df_Germany <- filter(df_master, Country=="Germany")
```

There are diffrent objects that can be used lateron:
* tsibbles
* vectors -> timeseries
* dataframes -> timeseries
---

### Data transformation into tsibble

A time series can be thought of as a list of numbers (the measurements), along with some information about what times those numbers were recorded (the index). This information can be stored as a tsibble object in R.

```{r}
tsibble_Germany <- as_tsibble(df_Germany, index=Year)
class(tsibble_Germany)
```

```{r}
tsibble_Germany

```


---
### Data transformation into vectors and time series   

In order to be able to work with the partial data sets later, we split the respective dataframe into individual vectors for different indexes.


```{r}
crimeGermanyVector <- df_Germany[,9]
crimeGermanyVector

costOfLivingVector <- df_Germany[,3]
costOfLivingVector

healthCareVector <- df_Germany[,11]
healthCareVector 

pollutionVector <- df_Germany[,13]
pollutionVector

```


```{r}
class(crimeGermanyVector)
```

---

Now we convert the vectors into times series.
```{r}
crimeGermanyTS <- ts(crimeGermanyVector, start=2012, end=2019, frequency=1)
costOfLivingGermanyTS <- ts(costOfLivingVector, start=2012, end=2019, frequency=1)
healthCareGermanyTS <- ts(healthCareVector, start=2012, end=2019, frequency=1)
pollutionGermanyTS <- ts(pollutionVector, start=2012, end=2019, frequency=1)
crimeGermanyTS
class(crimeGermanyTS)
```


---
### Data transformation from dataframes into time series   

Converting the dataframe into a times series (dataframe is coerced to a numeric matrix)
```{r}
GermanyTS <- ts(df_Germany, start=2012, end=2019, frequency=1)
GermanyTS
```

---
class: center, middle

## Model choice

---
There are many different models to analyize times series. 

How do we chose the right model?
1. Visual inspection: is there seasonality or trend?
2. Is decomposition technique additive or multiplicative? (Log tranformation if required)
3. Chosing the appropriate model, e.g. 

Model                                  |   Seasonal?  |    Trend?    | Correlations?
---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------
Simple Moving Average Smoothing        |      no      |     yes      |      no 
Seasonal Adjustments                   |      yes     |     yes      |      no 
Simple Exponential Smoothing           |      no      |     yes      |      no 
Holts Exponential Smoothing            |      no      |     yes      |      no 
Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing     |      yes     |     yes      |      no 
ARIMA                                  |      yes     |     yes      |      yes 

4. Testing of the model
5. Verification of the model performance

## Modelling

class: center, middle
### Some simple forecasting methods

---

#### Average method

The forecasted values are equal to the average (or **“mean”**) of the historical data. 
h is the time horizon for the forecast.
```{r echo=FALSE}
meanf(crimeGermanyTS, h=3)
```


---

#### Naïve method (random walk forecasts)

The **last value** of the historical data is set as predicted value. 
h is the time horizon for the forecast.
```{r echo=FALSE}
naive(crimeGermanyTS, h=3)
```

Variation: **Drift method**   
Change over time (=drift) is the **average change** in the historical data.
```{r echo=FALSE}
driftCrime <- rwf(crimeGermanyTS, h=3, drift=TRUE)
driftCrime

```


---
#### Plotting the forecasts

```{r echo=FALSE}
crimeGermanyPlot <- window(crimeGermanyTS,start=2012,end=2019)
# Plot some forecasts
autoplot(crimeGermanyPlot) +
  autolayer(meanf(crimeGermanyPlot, h=3),
    series="Mean", PI=FALSE) +
  autolayer(naive(crimeGermanyPlot, h=3),
    series="Naïve", PI=FALSE) +
  autolayer(rwf(crimeGermanyTS, h=3, drift=TRUE),
    series="Naïve Drift Method", PI=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Forecasts for Crime Index") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Crime Index") +
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Forecast"))
```


---

#### Evaluating Forecast Accuracy

For the three methods Mean, Naïve Method and Drift Method the Accuracy can be deducted from comparison of forecasts 2017-2019 and real data.


```{r include=FALSE}
crime1 <- meanf(window(crimeGermanyTS, start=2012, end=2016), h=3)
crime2 <- rwf(window(crimeGermanyTS, start=2012, end=2016), h=3)
crime3 <- rwf(window(crimeGermanyTS, start=2012, end=2016), drift=TRUE, h=3)
autoplot(crimeGermanyPlot) +
  autolayer(crime1, PI=FALSE, series="Mean") +
  autolayer(crime2, PI=FALSE, series="Naïve") +
  autolayer(crime3, PI=FALSE, series="Naïve Drift Method") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Crime Index") +
  ggtitle("Forecast for Crime Index Germany") +
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Forecast"))
```



```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Set training data from 2012 to 2016
train <- select(tsibble_Germany,`Crime Index`) %>% filter_index("2012" ~ "2016")
# Fit the models
crime_fit <- train %>%
  model(
    `Mean` = MEAN(`Crime Index`),
    `Naïve` = NAIVE(`Crime Index`),
    `Drift` = NAIVE(`Crime Index` ~ drift())
  )
# Generate forecasts for 3 years
crime_fc <- crime_fit %>% forecast(h=3)
# Plot forecasts against actual values
crime_fc %>%
  autoplot(train, level = NULL) +
    autolayer(filter_index(select(tsibble_Germany,`Crime Index`), "2016" ~ "2019"), color = "black") +
    ggtitle("Forecast for Crime Index Germany") +
    xlab("Year") + ylab("Crime Index") +
    guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Forecast"))

Exponential smoothing models:
* weighted averages of past observations  
* the older the (past) observation is the (exponentially) lower is the weigh

Simplest model is the **Simple Exponential Smoothing model (SES)**.  
It is suitable for forecasting data with no clear trend or seasonal pattern.

---

#### Flat forecasts
Simple exponential smoothing has a “flat” forecast  

```{r}
crimeGermanySes <- window(crimeGermanyTS,start=2012,end=2019)
fc_ses <- ses(crimeGermanySes, h=3)
fc_ses

```

---
Optimazation of the model:
*unknown parameters and the initial values for any exponential smoothing method can be estimated by for example minimizing the SSE
```{r}
# Estimate parameters
fit_ets <- tsibble_Germany %>%
  model(ETS(`Crime Index` ~ error("A") + trend("N") + season("N"), opt_crit = "mse"))
fc_ets <- fit_ets %>%
  forecast(h = 3)

# Accuracy of one-step-ahead training errors
accuracy(fit_ets)
```

---

```{r}
fc_ets %>%
  autoplot(tsibble_Germany) +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted, colour = "Fitted"), data = augment(fit_ets)) +
  ylab("Crime Index") + xlab("Year")
```
 In red the one-step-ahead fitted values plotted

### Simple moving average

---
#### General

The Moving average model creates predictions based on the average of a subset of past values.

### Autocorrelation  
Autocorrelation measures the linear relationship between lagged values of a time series.
This means we measure the relationship between: 
y~t~ and y~t-1~
y~t~ and y~t-2~
y~t~ and y~t-3~
etc.


```{r echo=FALSE}
#lag.plot(crimeGermanyTS,lags=7,do.lines=FALSE) # Variante 1

tsibble_Germany %>%  gg_lag(`Crime Index`, geom="point")  # Variante 2
```

The autocorrelations are the correlations associated with these scatterplots.
The highest positiv relationship is at lags 1 and 2.

---

The autocorrelations coefficients are displayed by the autocorrelation function ggAcf function  


```{r echo=FALSE}
# ggAcf(crimeGermanyTS) # Variante 1
autoplot(ACF(tsibble_Germany, `Crime Index`)) # Variante 2

```

The dashed blue lines (±2/√T where T is the length of the time, in our case ±0,76) indicate whether the correlations are significantly different from zero.
In our case no correlation is significant. 
Time series that show no autocorrelation are called *white noise*.

### Linear Model

---

Could there be a linearity?

```{r warning=FALSE}
tsibble_Germany %>% select(`Crime Index`) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=`Crime Index`)) +
    ylab("Crime Index)") +
    xlab("Years") +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```

---

```{r}
tsibble_Germany %>%
  model(TSLM(`Crime Index` ~ Year)) %>%
  report()
```

Contraints for our use case:
* In year 0 we certainly did not have a crime index of -4199
* Furtermore, an improvement of the crime index is possible and probable over a long period leading to a non-linearity
---

First we train the model with TSLM() (time series linear model).

```{r}
fit_tslm <- tsibble_Germany %>%  model(trend_model = TSLM(`Crime Index` ~ trend()))

```


---
Assuming that the linear development will continue we plot the scenario funnel

```{r echo=FALSE}
fit_tslm %>% forecast(h = "3 years") %>%
    autoplot(tsibble_Germany) +
    ggtitle("Crime Index for Germany") + ylab("Crime Index")
```

## Overall conclusion

The application of pure data-driven models based on historical data is not appropriate to come to conclusions how the crime index will develop in future.  
Furthermore domain knowledge is required to come to conclusions about the reasons for the past increase and how to improve the situation.
