# Project Description

---
## Project Goals

--

- Analysis of perceived crime

--

 - Analysis of Numbeo data (globally)

--

 - Hypothesis testing (Germany)
 
--

- Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of crime in Germany

--

- Dashboarding of Numbeo data

---
## Hypothesis

&gt; The perceived crime of people in Germany is not caused by actual criminality, but is driven by the negative news coverage of the refugee influx.

---
## Data Sources

--

**Numbeo** 

--

[Numbeo](www.numbeo.com) is the world’s largest database of user contributed data about cities and countries worldwide.  

Numbeo provides information on world living conditions including *cost of living*, *housing indicators*, *health care*, *traffic*, *crime* and *pollution*.  

--

**Statista**   

--

[Statista](https://de.statista.com/) is a German online portal providing statistical data collected by market and opinion research institutes and data derived from the economic sector and official statistics.  

We used it for statistical 'real' *crime rates* and number of *applications for asylum* in Germany.

## Technical setup of PostgreSQL

---
class: center, middle
### Establishing Connection to PostgreSQL

---







---

### Creation of a Database
A database with the name "NumbeoR" in PostgreSQL has to be created manually by the user. 

.center[
&lt;img src="pics/databaseCreationPostgreSQL.PNG" width="800" height="300" /&gt;
]

---

### Creation of Tables




Six different tables need to be created:



---
class: center, middle

## Data Import to PostgreSQL

---
The basic activity in the beginning of the project is to read in the JSON files containing scraped data from NumbeoR, to create dataframe and finally memorizing the data into PostgreSQL.




---
class: center, middle
## Data Export from PostgreSQL

---
class: center, middle
### SQL Queries

---
#### Cost of Living in Germany



---
#### Countries with very high CO2 pollutions in 2019



---

#### Average Crime Index from 2012 - 2019




---
class: center, middle

### Creating Master Dataframe

---
#### Data Import from PostgreSQL

Import of the different tables with the help of *dbGetQuery* function



---
#### Joining Dataframes (Tables)

Joining the data to one master dataframe with a *nested full_join* function








---

class: center, middle

## Extend Master Dataframe with Continent 

---

Furthermore we would like to add the information in which continent the country is.

Therefore we import a table which includes a country continent mapping.



---

Checking the data types we see that the data was defined as factors



Therefore we change the data types to characters 




---

Now we can join the continents to the master dataframe with the help of a left_join function:



Checking the number of NA values within the column 'Continent' shows that there are no ones




For every country one contintent could be assigened.



---
class: center, middle

## Change the Column Names

---

We will change the column names so that there are no *blanks* anymore.




---

# Data Understanding and Preparation

---
## General Approach

* Detailed inspection of data and data structure
* Selection of content to be used afterwards
* Data cleansing (e.g. outlier, NAs, NaNs)
* Final validation and verification of data set

---

## Data Inspection

---

A summary of dataframe structure and data types can be illustrated with the glimpse function:

## Data Selection

---

Selection of variables which are to be used in later analyses



---

The data structure is:

class: center, middle

## Data Cleansing

---
### Deletion of Outliers

---
### Deletion of NA Values

Sum of NA values can be ascertained as following:


The observations which contain at least one NA values can be identified with the following command:



---

All rows containing NA values can be deleted with the na.omit function:



Checking on how many NA values are in the new clean dataframe shows that there are none



---

The new structure of the dataframe is

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---
## Approach and Goal

In this chapter we would like to examine the data especially with respect to the Crime Index.  

Here we would like to see if we can discover correlations between the Crime Index and other variables from Numbeo.  
Furthermore we would like to see verify the hypothesis from the beginning:

"The perceived crime of people in Germany is not caused by actual criminality, but is driven by the negative news coverage of the refugee influx."

---
class: center, middle

## Data Preparation for EDA

---
### Dataframe for 2019



---
### Numeric Dataframe











---
### Dataframe for Germany

For some analysis we will focus only on German data
Filter dataframe only for Germany



---

class: center, middle

## Correlations Numbeo Variables

---
### Correlation Matrix

First, a correlation matrix will be generated with the help of the corrplot package:  




---

For the *Crime Index* we assume a correlation especially with the  
* *Cost of Living Index*, 
* *Local Purchasing Power Index* and 
* *CO2 Emission Index*.  

This will be examined in the following.

--- 

### Crimes vs. Cost of Living

The function rcorr() [in Hmisc package] can be used to compute the significance levels (p-value) for pearson or spearman correlations. It returns both the correlation coefficients and the p-value of the correlation for all possible pairs of columns in the data table.

Here, we show the (negative) correlation of two variables *Crime Index* and *Cost of Living Index*:


**Result**: No significant correlation is existing.

---

### Crimes vs. Local Purchasing Power

Here, we show the (negative) correlation of two variables *Crime Index* and *Local Purchasing Power Index*:


**Result**: No significant correlation is existing. 

---

### Crimes  vs. CO2 Emission

Here, we show the (positive) correlation of the tow variables *Crime Index* and *CO2 Emission Index*:



---

class: center, middle

## Correlations for Hypothesis Testing

---

### Crime Index vs. Number of Refugees

Correlation of perceived crimes and the estimated number refugees in Germany
(number of refugeesis an estimation and is derived from accumulation of number of asylum seekers from 2012 till 2019)



.footnote[
The historical number of asylum seekers are from: [statista](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/76095/umfrage/asylantraege-insgesamt-in-deutschland-seit-1995/)
]

---
### Crime Index vs. Real Crime Rates

Correlation of perceived crimes and number of registered crime rates. 
(number of refugees estimated derived from cumulation of number of asylum seekers from 2012 till 2019)



**Result**: The real crime rates seem not to influence how secure people think they are. 

.footnote[
The historical number of registered crimes are from: [statista](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/197/umfrage/straftaten-in-deutschland-seit-1997/)
]

---
### Conclusion Hypothesis Testing

The hypothesis can be confirmed.  
The real crime rates do not have impact on how secure people feel.  
However, the number of refugees correlates with the how people perceive the crime rate.  
The reasons behind that should be analyzed in more depth. 
We think that the negative reportings in the media and politics lead to this results.

# Forecasting / Times Series Analysis


---

## General 

What? 
We are going to analyse the **crime rate**.

What for?
We are analyizing the crime rate for **Germany**?

For which time horizon?
We are analyizing the crime rate for Germany for the years **2012 until 2019**?

## Data Preparation

---
### Preparation Dataframe


There are diffrent objects that can be used lateron:
* tsibbles
* vectors -&gt; timeseries
* dataframes -&gt; timeseries
---

### Data Transformation into Tsibble

A time series can be thought of as a list of numbers (the measurements), along with some information about what times those numbers were recorded (the index). This information can be stored as a tsibble object in R.







---
### Data Transformation into Vectors and Time Series   

In order to be able to work with the partial data sets later, we split the respective dataframe into individual vectors for different indexes.







---

Now we convert the vectors into times series.



---
class: center, middle

## Model Choice

---
There are many different models to analyize times series. 

How do we chose the right model?
1. Visual inspection: is there seasonality or trend?
2. Is decomposition technique additive or multiplicative? (Log tranformation if required)
3. Chosing the appropriate model, e.g. 

Model                                  |   Seasonal?  |    Trend?    | Correlations?
---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------
Simple Moving Average Smoothing        |      no      |     yes      |      no 
Seasonal Adjustments                   |      yes     |     yes      |      no 
Simple Exponential Smoothing           |      no      |     yes/no   |      no 
Holts Exponential Smoothing            |      no      |     yes      |      no 
Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing     |      yes     |     yes      |      no 
ARIMA                                  |      yes     |     yes      |      yes 

4. Testing of the model
5. Verification of the model performance

## Modelling

---
class: center, middle
### Some simple forecasting methods

---

#### Average method

The forecasted values are equal to the average (or **“mean”**) of the historical data. 
h is the time horizon for the forecast.



---

#### Naïve method (random walk forecasts)

The **last value** of the historical data is set as predicted value. 
h is the time horizon for the forecast.


Variation: **Drift method**   
Change over time (=drift) is the **average change** in the historical data.



---
#### Plotting the forecasts




---

#### Evaluating Forecast Accuracy

For the three methods Mean, Naïve Method and Drift Method the Accuracy can be deducted from comparison of forecasts 2017-2019 and real data.










---
class: center, middle
### Simple exponential smoothing

---
#### General

Exponential smoothing models:
* weighted averages of past observations  
* the older the (past) observation is the (exponentially) lower is the weigh

Simplest model is the **Simple Exponential Smoothing model (SES)**.  
It is suitable for forecasting data with no clear trend or seasonal pattern.

---

#### Flat forecasts
Simple exponential smoothing has a “flat” forecast  



---
Optimazation of the model:
*unknown parameters and the initial values for any exponential smoothing method can be estimated by for example minimizing the SSE


---


 In red the one-step-ahead fitted values plotted

---
Including an (additive) trend perspective will change the forecast:

*unknown parameters and the initial values for any exponential smoothing method can be estimated by for example minimizing the SSE


---
#### Trend forecasts


---
class: center, middle
### Simple moving average

---
#### General

The Moving average model creates predictions based on the average of a subset of past values. 

---

### Autocorrelation  
Autocorrelation measures the linear relationship between lagged values of a time series.
This means we measure the relationship between: 
y~t~ and y~t-1~
y~t~ and y~t-2~
y~t~ and y~t-3~
etc.




The autocorrelations are the correlations associated with these scatterplots.
The highest positiv relationship is at lags 1 and 2.

---

The autocorrelations coefficients are displayed by the autocorrelation function ggAcf function  




The dashed blue lines (±2/√T where T is the length of the time, in our case ±0,76) indicate whether the correlations are significantly different from zero.
In our case no correlation is significant. 
Time series that show no autocorrelation are called *white noise*. 

---
class: center, middle

### Linear Model

---

Could there exist a linearity?



---



Contraints for our use case:
* In year 0 we certainly did not have a crime index of -4199
* Furtermore, an improvement of the crime index is possible and probable over a long period leading to a non-linearity
---

First we train the model with TSLM() (time series linear model).




---
Assuming that the linear development will continue we plot the scenario funnel

# Dashboarding in Shiny

---
## Data Export 
The complete master dataframe and clean dataframe is export for further usage in Shiny dashboarding.

# Overall conclusion

The application of pure data-driven models based on historical data is not appropriate to come to conclusions how the crime index will develop in future.  
Furthermore domain knowledge is required to come to conclusions about the reasons for the past increase and how to improve the situation.
